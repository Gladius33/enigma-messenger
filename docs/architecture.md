enigma-core centers on a Core runtime that loads local identity, applies policy, persists state, and routes envelopes across transports. Modules isolate concerns: config/policy, identity and directories, sessions and ratchets, packet handling with attachment chunking, relay integration, messaging pipeline, group and channel state, sync, and extension points. An event bus surfaces incoming events to consumers. Transports are abstracted via a trait with mock and adapter implementations.
