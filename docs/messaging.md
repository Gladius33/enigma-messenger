Messaging supports text, media, attachments via chunking, edits/deletes via tombstones, receipts, typing indicators, and ephemeral timers. Conversation identifiers are deterministic for direct dialogs and stored for groups/channels. Messages carry ratcheted encryption payloads and additional authenticated data. Policy gates request sizes and rates while allowing unlimited total attachment sizes through chunking.
